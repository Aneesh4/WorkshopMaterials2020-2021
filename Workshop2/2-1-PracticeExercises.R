# Practice Exercises for Workshop 2 Part 1
# Note, not all of these exercises require the use of R. It may be beneficial 
# for you to figure out how to do them in R, but it is not necessary

# A biased coin lands heads with probability 2/3. The coin is tossed 3 times. 
# Given that there was at least one head in the 3 tosses, what is the 
# probability that there were at least two heads? Use your answer to the 
# previous question to find the probability that there was exactly one head in 
# the three tosses given that there was at least one head in the three tosses.
# Now, what if the coin was actually biased with probability 0.68 to land heads, 
# how would your answer to the two questions change?



# Observe how the sample mean of larger and larger samples come closer to the 
# mean of the chi square distribution with three degrees of freedom
# by computing the sample mean of random samples of 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, 
# 10000, and 100000


# Observe how the sample mean of larger and larger samples of the exponential 
# distribution come closer to the expectation by computing the sample mean of
# random samples of 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000


# Which sequence of sample means converged faster? That of the chi-squared 
# distribution or the exponential distribution

# Why might that be true?


# Take random samples of 100, 500, and 1000 from the t distribution with 5 
# degrees of freedom and from the normal distribution. Compute the difference 
# between the maximum values for each sample size. What does this show? Why does 
# this matter?
